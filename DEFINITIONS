transit-free definition:

o Disconnection of the peering between two transit-free networks will partition the internet.
o Transit-free Networks won't use any intermediate networks to reach any other self-proclaimed transit-free network.

starting point: given the adjacencies of a a self-proclaimed transit-free
network such as AS 2914, all transit-freee networks must be present in the set
of 2914-adjacencies.
